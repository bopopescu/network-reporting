  Viewport meta tag: used by the iOS SDK to keep iPad interstitials properly
  centered. On legacy SDKs (version < 6), inclusion of this tag causes a
  divide-by-zero exception, so we should omit it for those versions.
  
  There are a few SDK revisions tagged with version == 6 that are affected by this
  crash. We can't distinguish the buggy v=6 revisions from working ones, but we can
  limit the crashes to iPad (way less commonly used) by only sending down the tag
  for tablet formats.
