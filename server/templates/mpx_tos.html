                    <p align="left"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><strong>MoPub Marketplace</strong> <strong>Terms and Conditions</strong></span></p>
<p>For the MoPub Ad Serving Terms and Conditions, go to <a href="http://www.mopub.com/legal/terms">http://www.mopub.com/legal/terms</a>.</p>
<p>These MoPub Marketplace Terms and Conditions (“Agreement”) between You and MoPub Inc. (“MoPub”) constitute the terms and conditions for your use of the MoPub Marketplace program (the “Marketplace”). “You” or “Your” means any entity identified in an enrollment form submitted by the same or affiliated persons, and/or any agency, network or other third party that You have granted access to Your account, all of whom will be bound by this Agreement.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Description of Program. The Marketplace allows You as a publisher to offer and sell Your available ad inventory (Your “Inventory”) to advertisers who are buyers in the Marketplace who desire to display and serve their ads (“Buyer Ads”) on the applications and sites that You designate (“Program Sites”), based upon the selling criteria selected by You via the MoPub online user interface provided by MoPub for accessing the Marketplace (“Marketplace Interface”).</li>
<li>Revenue Share. The Marketplace allows you to monetize Your Inventory on your Program Sites by paying you a revenue share of the fees collected by MoPub from buyers.  If You are accepted as a publisher in the Marketplace, MoPub will pay You a percentage of the “Net Marketplace Revenue” generated by Your Inventory, which percentage you can view by logging into your account via the Program Interface. The amount resulting from applying the percentage to the Net Marketplace Revenue will be the “Revenue Share Fee.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“Net Marketplace Revenue” means fees actually collected by MoPub from third party advertisers whose Buyer Ads were served to Your Inventory, less any media buying fees or bid reductions, operating fees, fraud, charge backs, refunds, uncollected amounts, credit card processing fees and other reasonable deductions.</p>
<p>MoPub will pay You the Revenue Share Fee within 60 days after the last day of the calendar month in which MoPub received the applicable Net Marketplace Revenue, provided that no payments will be issued for any amount less than $100 U.S and any unpaid earnings will rollover and accrue to the next pay period.  If You are both a Marketplace customer (under these this Agreement) and a MoPub Premier customer (under the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MoPub Ad Serving Terms and Conditions</span>), then at MoPub’s election, MoPub may offset the Net Marketplace Revenue owed to You by the amount of Ad Serving Fees owed to MoPub.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Implementation of Program. You will implement the Program in a manner that complies with the technical and implementation requirements provided by MoPub from time to time, which may include integration or distribution of software, implementation of APIs or SDKs, complying with protocols and any other instructions contained in the MoPub documentation (the “Protocol”).</li>
<li>Your Obligations.</li>

In connection with the operation of the Program, MoPub collects and receives data that MoPub collects during delivery of Ads or performance of our obligations under this Agreement (“Data”).

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(b)    User Volunteered Data. If Customer enables the collection of any User Volunteered Data via Ads, You must expressly disclose to such individual end user that such collection is solely on behalf of You or your Advertisers (and not MoPub).

You will not use MoPub’s Brand Features in any news release, public announcement, advertisement, or other form of publicity in relation to this Agreement without securing the prior written consent of MoPub.</li>
<li>Disclaimer. You acknowledge that the Program is still experimental in nature. MoPub does not represent or warrant that the Program is reliable, accurate, complete, or otherwise free from defects. Accordingly, the Program is made available for use “as is”, and any use thereof will be undertaken solely at Your own risk. MoPub reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to include or cease providing the Program at any time (subject to notice as may be required herein), and MoPub does not give or enter into any conditions, warranties or other terms with regard to the Program. In particular, no condition, warranty or other term is given or entered into to the effect that the Program will be of satisfactory quality, noninfringement or that the Program will be fit for any particular purpose. For the avoidance of doubt, MoPub does not guarantee the Program will be operable at all times or during any down time (i) caused by outages to any public Internet backbones, networks or servers, (ii) caused by any failures of Your equipment, systems or local access services, (iii) for previously scheduled maintenance or (iv) relating to events beyond MoPub’s (or its wholly owned subsidiaries’) control such as strikes, riots, insurrection, fires, floods, explosions, war, governmental action, labor conditions, earthquakes, natural disasters, or interruptions in Internet services to an area where MoPub (or its wholly owned subsidiaries) or Your servers are located or co-located.</li>
<li>Limitation of Liability. MOPUB AND ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD-PARTY CLAIMANT FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE PROGRAM), OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON A CLAIM OR ACTION OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER TORT, BREACH OF ANY STATUTORY DUTY, INDEMNITY OR CONTRIBUTION, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF MOPUB AND/OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS IN THIS AND THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPH MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In any event, MoPub’s (and its wholly owned subsidiaries’) total cumulative liability to You or any other party for any loss or damages resulting from any claims, demands, or actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement will not exceed U.S. $500.</li>
<li>Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant that: (a) You have and will maintain throughout the Program Term all rights, authorizations and licenses (including without limitation any copyright, trademark, patent, publicity or other rights) that are required with respect to Your Program Sites, to display Buyer Ads on the Program Sites, and to permit MoPub to perform the Services contemplated under this Agreement; (b) You will not advertise anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent business practice; (c) all of the information provided by You to MoPub to enroll in the Program is correct and current at all times; (d) You have all necessary right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform the acts required of You hereunder; and (e) You have complied and will continue to comply with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations (including without limitation the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and any relevant data protection or privacy laws) in Your performance of any acts hereunder; (f) You comply with and have any and all consents, authorizations and clearances from end users of the Program Sites to allow MoPub to collect and use the Data in accordance with Section 7(a), and as may be required for MoPub to provide services hereunder; (g) You will at all times comply with MoPub Policies.</li>
<li>Indemnify. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold MoPub, its agents, affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, and applicable third parties (e.g. relevant advertisers, syndication partners, licensors, licensees, consultants and contractors) (collectively “Indemnified Persons”) harmless from and against any and all third party claims, liability, loss, and expense (including damage awards, settlement amounts, and reasonable legal fees), brought against any Indemnified Person(s), arising out of, related to or which may arise from Your use of the Program, the Program Sites, and/or Your breach of any term of this Agreement.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous. All claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, USA and MoPub and You consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Program. Any notices to MoPub must be sent to: MoPub Inc. with a copy to Legal Department, via first class or air mail or overnight courier, and are deemed given upon receipt. Notice to You may be effected by sending email to the email address specified in Your account, or by posting a message to Your account interface, and is deemed received when sent (for email) or no more than 15 days after having been posted (for messages in Your Program Interface). MoPub’s waiver of any default is not a waiver of any subsequent default. Unenforceable provisions will be modified to reflect the parties’ intention, and remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect. You may not assign any of Your rights hereunder and any such attempt is void. MoPub and You are not legal partners or agents, but are independent contractors. Sections 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.</li>
